# Optimizing Operations and Enhancing Experiences with Data Science and Machine Learning: PPG Dataset Insights üé®

This repository contains the analysis and machine learning models used to solve key business challenges at **PPG**. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, the project generates insights that optimize logistics, improve product design and quality, and enhance customer experiences.

## üìù Project Overview

This project, in association with the **University of Pittsburgh**, utilizes **regression** and **classification** tasks to generate valuable business insights. By analyzing color model inputs, the model predicts important paint properties and identifies popular paint products.

### Key Business Challenges Addressed:
1. **Logistics Optimization**: Improving distribution and delivery efficiency.
2. **Product Design & Quality Improvement**: Predicting paint properties and enhancing product features.
3. **Customer Experience Enhancement**: Identifying popular paint products and tailoring offerings.

### Machine Learning Tasks:
- **Regression**: Predicting a key paint property based on color model inputs.
- **Classification**: Identifying popular paint products using those inputs.

## üîß Technologies and Skills

- **R**: Core programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Tidyverse**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Classification**: Identifying popular products.
- **Regression**: Predicting paint properties.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding patterns and relationships in the data.

## üöÄ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data cleaning and preparation using `tidyverse` tools.
   - Handling missing values and outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing trends and correlations between color model inputs and paint properties.

3. **Regression Task**:
   - Building regression models to predict paint properties from input data.

4. **Classification Task**:
   - Applying classification techniques to identify popular paint products.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Using evaluation metrics (RMSE, accuracy, etc.) to assess model performance.

## üìà Results

The regression task provided accurate predictions of paint properties based on color model inputs, allowing for better quality control and product design. The classification model identified popular paint products, helping PPG target high-demand products and improve customer satisfaction.
